            Iâ€™m Stephen, a web developer and designer with a background in
            Electrical and Electronics Engineering. My passion for solving
            technical problems has led me to explore the exciting world of web
            development, to create engaging digital experiences. I specialize in
            front-end development using React, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS, while
            Figma helps me design intuitive interfaces. For the backend, I use
            Firebase to ensure smooth functionality. Beyond coding, I enjoy
            solving complex problems, reading, staying updated on web
            development trends, and watching football.
